                    <span class="text-2">(2) Some vehicles stopped in violation are exempt from fines due to business reasons. For vehicles that are exempt, are there repeat offenders? Where are exempt vehicles frequently in violation?</span>
                    In the case of an exemption there are often repeat offenders that were issued violations upward to 1000+ times, 
                    Of the repeat offenders it is primarily from emergency vehicles and commercial vehicles.

                    <span class="text-2">(3) Some automated camera-enforced routes travel within or across Manhattan’s Central Business District. How have violations on these routes changed alongside the implementation of congestion pricing?</span>
                    Since the implementation of congestion pricing in 2025, we’ve seen an increase in violations which has nearly met the total previously issued violations from 2024, however we’ve also seen an uptick in exempt violations which requires further investigation.
