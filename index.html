                    <span class="text-2">(2) Some vehicles stopped in violation are exempt from fines due to business reasons. For vehicles that are exempt, are there repeat offenders? Where are exempt vehicles frequently in violation?</span>
                    In the case of an exemption there are often repeat offenders that were issued violations upward to 1000+ times, 
                    Of the repeat offenders it is primarily from emergency vehicles and commercial vehicles.

                    <span class="text-2">(3) Some automated camera-enforced routes travel within or across Manhattanâ€™s Central Business District. How have violations on these routes changed alongside the implementation of congestion pricing?</span>
                    Since the implementation of congestion pricing in 2025, weâ€™ve seen an increase in violations which has nearly met the total previously issued violations from 2024, however weâ€™ve also seen an uptick in exempt violations which requires further investigation.
